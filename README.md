# NEWCOMERS

This project was created for front-end side of welcoming site for newcomers at my chuch, New Frontier Church in New York.

## Why I came up with this project

I served at NFC (New Frontier Church) in newcomers team since 2013. Being part of the team member for 7 years, and then serving as the newcomers team leader for a year, my team members and I found it cumbersome organizing newcomers' info details into Google spreadsheet. We often discussed on how to effectively gather information and organize them. After we gether information on Sunday, we would often forget or delay on updating the spreadsheet during the week. 

This project is the page for newcomers to enter and provide their information in a friedly and welcoming manner! 

Implementing this app, the newcomers team members can now focus more on getting to know and welcoming the newcomers, taking load off from the administrative tasks. 

## To get started on your local server
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# NFC NEWCOMERS

NFC_Newcomers is the New Frontier Church Newcomers app, a front-end single page application that allows newcomers to easily input and submit their information to our church. My goal with this project was to create a more efficient and welcoming process for newcomers to engage with our church.

## Motivation for the project

I have been a member of the newcomers team at NFC since 2013, and have served as team leader for a year. During my time on the team, my fellow team members and I found it challenging to keep track of newcomers' information using a Google spreadsheet. It was often difficult to gather and organize the information, and we struggled to keep the spreadsheet up to date.

This project was created as a friendly and welcoming way for newcomers to provide their information. By implementing this app, the newcomers team can focus on building relationships with newcomers, rather than being bogged down by administrative tasks. The app aims to streamline the process of gathering and organizing newcomers' information, allowing the team to more effectively welcome and get to know newcomers.

## To get started on your local server

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Technologies used to build the project

-Structured with **HTML** and **React**, using vanilla **CSS** for styling.

-Selected and implemented the color scheme, using tools such as **ColorSpace** and **CSS Gradient**.

-Animated the welcoming phrases in the center of the page using the JavaScript library **TypeIt**.

-Utilized the **Haikei** design tool to create organic-shaped buttons that lead to the church's other sites, optimizing for a fast loading time by using the lightweight SVG format.

-Carried out input form validation to ensure that users received error messages when necessary. 

-Deployed with Render (visit: https://nfc-newcomers.onrender.com/)
